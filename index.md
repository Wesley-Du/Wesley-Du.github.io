# <font size="6"> What is Analytics Zoo? </font>

Analytics Zoo provides a unified data analytics and AI platform that seamlessly unites TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Spark, Flink and Ray programs into an integrated pipeline, which can transparently scale from a laptop to large clusters to process production big data.

[![analytics zoo block](/assets/analytics_zoo_block.png)](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#)

**Integrated Analytics and AI Pipelines** for easily prototyping and deploying end-to-end analytics and AI applications. 

  - Write [TensorFlow](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/##distributed-tensorflow-and-keras-on-sparkbigdl) or [PyTorch](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#ProgrammingGuide/pytorch/) inline with Spark code for distributed training and inference.

  - Native deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch/BigDL) support in [Spark ML](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/##nnframes) Pipelines.

  - Directly run Ray programs on big data cluster through [RayOnSpark](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#ProgrammingGuide/rayonspark/). 

  - Plain Java/Python APIs for (TensorFlow/PyTorch/BigDL/OpenVINO) [model inference](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/##model-serving) easily. 

High-Level **ML Workflow** that automates the process of building large-scale machine learning applications.

  - Automatically distributed real-time serving (for TensorFlow/PyTorch/Caffe/BigDL/ OpenVINO models) with a simple pub/sub API. 

  - Scalable AutoML for time series prediction (that automatically generates features, selects models and tunes hyperparameter).

**Built-in Algorithms and Models** for [recommendation](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/recommendation/), [time series](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/anomaly-detection/), [computer vision](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/object-detection/) and [NLP](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/seq2seq/) applications.

# <font size="6">Why use Analytics Zoo? </font>

You may want to develop your AI solution using Analytics Zoo if:

- You want to easily prototype the entire end-to-end pipeline that apply AI models (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, BigDL, etc.) to production big data.

- You want to transparently scale your application from a laptop to large clusters with "zero" code changes.

- You want to deploy your AI pipelines to existing YARN or K8S clusters WITHOUT any modifications to the clusters.

- You want to automate the process of applying machine learning (such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model selection and distributed inference).
