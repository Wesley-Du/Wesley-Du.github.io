# <font size="6"> What is Analytics Zoo? </font>

Analytics Zoo is an Open Source Data Analytics and AI solution platform that seamlessly unites Spark, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Ray and BigDL programs into an integrated pipeline that transparently scales on production environment. 

Analytics Zoo provides **Integrated Analytics and AI pipelines**, **ML Workflow** and **Built-in Algorithms and Models** that help you develop your solutions more easily. 

[![analytics zoo block](/assets/analytics_zoo_block.png)](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#)

With the **Integrated Analytics and AI pipelines**, you can develop AI pipelines on popular Analytics or ML/DL infrastructures and tools. 

  - Use native [Spark Dataframes](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/##nnframes) and Analytics Zoo ML/DL APIs to create [ML/DL pipelines](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/##nnframes).

  - Write [TensorFlow](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/##distributed-tensorflow-and-keras-on-sparkbigdl) or [PyTorch](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#ProgrammingGuide/pytorch/) code inline with Spark code, and run in a distributed fashion.

  - Develop emerging AI applications with [RayOnSpark](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#ProgrammingGuide/rayonspark/). 

  - Conduct standalone [Model Serving](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/##model-serving) easily. 

With the **ML Workflow**, your Analytics or ML/DL solution can be more automated and easy to use.

  - Use [AutoML]() capability to automatically search for best solutions to your problems, such as feature transforming, hyperparameter and model searching. 

  - Use [Cluster Serving]() capability to quickly carry out distributed streaming inference with simple single thread Python programs.

With the **Built-in Algorithms and Models**, you can develop applications - such as [recommendation](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/recommendation/), [time series](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/anomaly-detection/), [computer vision](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/object-detection/) and [NLP](https://analytics-zoo.github.io/master/#APIGuide/Models/seq2seq/) - more quickly.

# <font size="6">Why use Analytics Zoo? </font>

You may want to develop your AI solution using Analytics Zoo if:

- You want to avoid the extra cost moving the large volume data, and develop AI solutions that naturally runs on the production systems

- You want to develop AI solutions on local machine and do not want to change to your cluster for development or deployment

- You want to develop real “End to End” AI pipeline from data connection, data preparation through model training, serving and inference

- You want to develop AI solutions with automation capabilities, such as automated scalability, AutoML etc.
